# SFDC-Template-Automation

Every time you spend hours or days to format Leads data before uploading it into Salesforce ?? <br/>
In addition to this, do you spend time to feed in inputs to certain static fields in Salesforce ? <br/>
Here's an application that automatically formats the fields for you. Also it gets inputs for static fields and completes the entire job within minutes.

## Avoid Manual Process
With this application you can avoid,
* **Formatting individual fields in Excel.** For example,

Field Name   | Format
------------ | -------------
  FirstName | PROPER
  LastName | PROPER
  email | LOWERCASE

* **Mismatch of field values.** For example,<br/>
Emails in phone fields, or Spouse names in Middle Name fields, or URLs in Email fields.

* **Blank values in 'Required Fields'** (Fields with red bar on the Salesforce page layouts)<br/>
Interface of this application includes almost all 'Required Fields'
